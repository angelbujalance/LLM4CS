They tailor their crops according to climate and soil, to optimise the natural growth cycle. Organic farmers also promote biodiversity, by growing a variety of crops, rather than one single crop. Through all of these methods, organic farmers prevent soil erosion, conserve energy, and help protect local wildlife, stream banks and watersheds.

Yep, you heard me right: I eat dairy products with all the fat god gave \u2018em, and I do it because it\u2019s good for me. Here\u2019s why:1. Our bodies cannot digest the protein or absorb the calcium from milk without the fat. Love This? Never Miss Another Story.2. Vitamins A and D are also fat-soluble.

Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (\u03b2-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA).

The cars comes with a 1,244-hp 7.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine giving it enough power to go at such high speeds. However, when it comes to Guinness World records Venom GT is still not considered as the fastest car in the world. The Guinness World record for the fastest car is held by the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport (second car in our list) at 269.86mph. The Venom GT reached the speed of 270.49mph at the Kennedy Space Center in a one-way run (NASA didn\u2019t allow running in the opposite direction). To break the Guinness World Record, it is compulsory to run in both directions to compensate for the wind conditions, so the Veyron Super Sport kept its title of fastest car in the world.",

The modern Funny Car, that nitro-burning, carbon fiber shell set a-trembling over a front engine tube chassis has its roots in the A/FX classes running in 1964 and 1965. Jack Chrisman\u2019s nitro-burning Comet in 1964 showed the crowd-pleasing abilities of a Top Fuel dragster in a dealer showroom suit.
