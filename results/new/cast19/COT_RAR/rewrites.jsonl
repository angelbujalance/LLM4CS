Additionally, some argue that functionalism places too much emphasis on consensus and integration, overlooking the ways in which social groups may have different interests and conflicting values. Overall, critics argue that the functionalist theory provides a limited understanding of society and fails to adequately account for social diversity and conflict.", "One of the main criticisms of the functionalist theory in sociology is that it tends to focus on the positive functions of social structures and institutions while neglecting the negative aspects or conflicts that may arise within them.

The functionalist theory views society as a complex system where various parts work together to maintain stability and harmony. It emphasizes the importance of social order, cohesion, and the functions that different institutions serve in society. On the other hand, the conflict theory focuses on the power struggles and inequalities within society. It argues that society is characterized by competition and conflict between different groups, with power and resources being unequally distributed. The conflict theory highlights the role of social class, race, and gender in shaping social relationships and institutions. While the functionalist theory emphasizes stability and consensus, the conflict theory emphasizes social change and the role of conflict in driving social progress.", "Conflict theory and functionalist theory are two major perspectives in sociology. While functionalist theory views society as a complex system with interdependent parts working together for social stability, conflict theory emphasizes social inequality and power struggles between different groups. The main difference between these theories lies in their understanding of social order and the forces that shape society. While functionalism focuses on how social institutions maintain stability and cohesion, conflict theory examines how power dynamics and social inequalities influence social change.", "The functionalist theory and the conflict theory are two major perspectives in sociology. While the functionalist theory focuses on the idea that society is composed of interdependent parts that work together to maintain social order, the conflict theory emphasizes the role of power and social inequality in shaping society.
