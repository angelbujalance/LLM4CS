Microevolution refers to small-scale genetic changes that occur within populations over a relatively short period of time. These changes can include variations in allele frequencies, adaptations to local environments, and the emergence of new traits. On the other hand, macroevolution refers to large-scale evolutionary changes that occur over longer periods of time and often result in the formation of new species or higher taxonomic groups. It involves the accumulation of microevolutionary changes, such as genetic mutations, genetic drift, and natural selection, which lead to the diversification of life forms. While microevolution focuses on the changes within a population, macroevolution studies the patterns and processes that shape the branching and diversification of different lineages.

Microevolution refers to small-scale genetic changes that occur within a population over a relatively short period of time. It involves changes in the frequency of alleles (different forms of a gene) within a population, leading to variations in traits. This process is driven by mechanisms such as natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. On the other hand, macroevolution refers to large-scale changes that occur over longer periods of time, resulting in the formation of new species or higher taxonomic groups. It involves the accumulation of microevolutionary changes over many generations, leading to the diversification of life forms. Examples of macroevolutionary events include the origin of new species, the development of novel adaptations, and major evolutionary transitions. While microevolution focuses on changes within populations, macroevolution explores the patterns and processes that shape the diversity of life on a broader scale.

It is often driven by natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow. On the other hand, macroevolution refers to large-scale changes that occur over long periods of time, resulting in the formation of new species and the diversification of life forms. It involves the accumulation of many microevolutionary changes and is typically associated with speciation events. While microevolution is observable within a short time frame, macroevolution occurs over millions of years and is evident in the fossil record and comparative anatomy, among other lines of evidence.
