Additionally, the functionalist theory has been criticized for its limited ability to explain social change and adaptation. It is often seen as too conservative and resistant to acknowledging the dynamic nature of society. Furthermore, some argue that the functionalist perspective overlooks the individual agency and the role of human action in shaping social structures and institutions. These criticisms have led to the development of alternative sociological theories that aim to address these limitations."]}
